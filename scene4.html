        <h2>Technological Innovation leads to productivity growth and higher national incomes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> <b>Technological
                Innovation</b>
                — defined broadly here to include physical machines as well as ideas, knowledge,
                and
                processes — makes it possible for each worker to become much more productive.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> This increase in
                productivity raises incomes, and eventually shortens working hours.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>
                A prime example of how tech innovation drives productivity growth is agriculture. Innovations like
                better machinery, crop varieties, fertilizers, and land
                management
                have enabled farmers to be much more productive.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span> In the US, for example,
                farm production per labour hour increased
                nearly 16-fold from 1948–2011. This increased productivity enables teh US to feed a rapidly growing
                population,
                even while the fraction of people working in agriculture is smaller than ever.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span> Besides tech innovation,
                there is evidence that working fewer hours can itself keep productivity higher,
                making
                the link between working hours and productivity self-reinforcing.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-up"/></span> Try selecting some
                countries from the dropdown filter
                to see how their productivities changed from 1950 - 2017
