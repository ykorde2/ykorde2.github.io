        <h2>Current and Future Impact of Extreme Temperatures on Mortality Rates</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indirect Causes of Temperature-Related Deaths:</strong> 
                    Most fatalities from extreme temperatures result from conditions like cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and respiratory infections, rather than direct heat stroke or hypothermia.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sub-Optimal Temperatures and Premature Deaths:</strong> 
                    Extreme temperatures contribute to a significant number of premature deaths each year, though they rarely appear directly on death certificates.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability of Older Adults:</strong> 
                    Individuals over 65 are especially at risk, with extreme temperatures exacerbating existing health issues and leading to earlier deaths.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Research Insights:</strong> 
                    Studies indicate that temperature extremes can reduce lifespans by at least one year, with excess death rates helping to estimate the impact of extreme temperatures.
                </li>
            </ul>

                This interactive slideshow analyzes the share of deaths from all causes attributed to cold or heat, estimates the change in the death rate from non-optimal temperatures, and projects the shift in temperature-related death rates relative to GDP per capita, and per capita CO₂ emissions.
