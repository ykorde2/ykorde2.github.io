        <h2>Current and Future Impact of Extreme Temperatures on Mortality Rates</h2>
        <div>

                <li class="font-size-lg mt-50"><strong>Indirect Causes of Temperature-Related Deaths:</strong> 
                    Most fatalities from extreme temperatures result from conditions like cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and respiratory infections, rather than direct heat stroke or hypothermia.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><strong>Sub-Optimal Temperatures and Premature Deaths:</strong> 
                    Extreme temperatures contribute to a significant number of premature deaths each year, though they rarely appear directly on death certificates.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><strong>Vulnerability of Older Adults:</strong> 
                    Individuals over 65 are especially at risk, with extreme temperatures exacerbating existing health issues and leading to earlier deaths.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><strong>Research Insights:</strong> 
                    Studies indicate that temperature extremes can reduce lifespans by at least one year, with excess death rates helping to estimate the impact of extreme temperatures.

                This interactive slideshow compares the working hours between different countries
                and the hours they work per year. We factor in data about the labour productivity in these
                countries and also their GDP per capita growth over the years.
