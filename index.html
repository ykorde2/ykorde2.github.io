        <h2>Have you wondered what the labour productivity and work hours look like in different countries?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-50"><span>&#128119;</span> For instance, countries like Myanmar have some of the lowest
                    GDP per capita but highest working hours.
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span>⚒️️</span> In Myanmar, the average worker puts in approximately 2400
                    hours each year, nearly 900 more hours than in France (1,500 hours).
                </li>
                <li class="font-size-lg mt-30">😓</span> The extra 900
                    hours for Myanmar workers means longer work days and far fewer holidays.

                This interactive slideshow compares the working hours between different countries
                and the hours they work per year. We factor in data about the labour productivity in these
                countries and also their GDP per capita growth over the years.
