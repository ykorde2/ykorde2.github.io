        <h2>Change in heat-related death rates vs. Per capita CO₂ emissions, 2030</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> There's a strong negative relationship between carbon emissions and projected mortality rates, with countries that have high emissions per person often seeing a decrease in heat-related deaths, while low-emission countries face an increase.
            </li>
            <li> A majority of oil-producing states with a CO₂ emissions per capita are expected to experience increased death rates, demonstrating a complex relationship between wealth, emissions, and temperature related mortality.
            </li>
            <li> Countries with minimal carbon emissions, often less than a few tonnes per person, will likely bear the brunt of increased death rates, despite contributing the least to global emissions, once again exhibiting climate change's inequality.
            </li>
