        <h2>Estimated change in the death rate from non-optimal temperatures from 2030 to 2090</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"> Countries such as Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Qatar are expected to see an increase in temperature related deaths with every 0.5°C of temperature increase by 2030 and beyond.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"> In countries like the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Canada, warmer temperatures are projected to reduce temperature-related deaths, likely due to milder winters and improved climate resilience.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"> In Spain, South Africa, and Brazil there is a projected decline in heat-related deaths until mid-century, followed with numbers rising by the end of the century.

                Select a country below, to see its projected death rate change from suboptimal temperatures from 2030 to 2090. Premature deaths are measured per 100,000 people, and based on data that shows 2°C of warming by 2050 and 2.5°C by 2100.
