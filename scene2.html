        <h2>Share of deaths from all causes attributed to cold or heat, 2015</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Most temperature-related deaths occur during "moderately cold" conditions, not during extreme cold or hot weather, due to the extended time people spend in these temperatures.
            </li>
            <li> In the UK, temperatures of 10°C to 15°C are associated with higher mortality risk, even though they are perceived as mild or "nice summer days."
            </li>
            <li> Sub-optimal temperatures can lead to premature deaths from conditions such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, respiratory infections, and diabetes.
            </li>
            <li> A study by Antonio Gasparrini et al. in The Lancet shows that "moderate cold" is the leading cause of temperature-related deaths worldwide, affecting countries from the UK to Brazil.
            </li>
            <li> Awareness and adaptation strategies should focus on the health risks of moderate cold, which are often underestimated compared to extreme weather conditions.
            </li>
